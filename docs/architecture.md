# Architecture

This document explains the package boundaries inside `neithly-monitor-sdk` and walks through the data flow of a single `captureException` call from user code all the way to the neithly-monitor backend.

It is the entry point for new contributors. For the *why* behind specific decisions, follow the cross-links to the ADRs.

## Goals

1. **One install, one boot call.** Consumer apps should add a single dependency for their runtime and call `Neithly.init({ dsn })`. Everything else is wired internally.
2. **Sentry-shaped public API.** Operators recognise `captureException`, `addBreadcrumb`, `setUser`, `setTags`, `withScope`. See [ADR-0002](./adr/0002-sentry-shaped-api-over-otel.md).
3. **OTLP/HTTP under the hood.** The backend already speaks OTLP on `/v1/logs`, `/v1/metrics`, `/v1/traces` with DSN bearer auth. We wrap the OTel SDK's official exporters with a DSN-aware auth header rather than rolling our own HTTP client.
4. **Strict workspace boundaries.** `monitor-core` is the only package that may be imported by every other. Runtime packages (`monitor-node`, `monitor-browser`) do not import each other. Framework bindings live in the runtime package they need (Express/Fastify/Nest inside `monitor-node`, React inside `monitor-react`).

### Rules

- `monitor-core` has zero runtime dependencies (`@opentelemetry/*` is a peer concept only at the boundary helper level; the actual OTel SDK lives in the runtime packages). It must stay under ~1k LoC of pure logic.
- `monitor-node` and `monitor-browser` both depend on `monitor-core` and expose the **same** `Neithly` singleton shape so application code is portable between runtimes. The shape is identical; the implementation differs:
  - `monitor-node` uses `AsyncLocalStorage` for `withScope`, batched OTel processors, and OS-level hooks (`process.on('uncaughtException')`).
  - `monitor-browser` uses a synchronous `withScope` (no ALS available), a fetch-based exporter, and `sendBeacon` on `pagehide` for in-flight envelopes.
- `monitor-react` depends only on `monitor-browser`. It never reaches into `monitor-core` directly; everything flows through the browser singleton.
- `monitor-cli` is independent — it talks to the backend's management API (`nmk_live_…` tokens), not the OTLP ingest endpoints. It only shares `monitor-core` for the DSN parser when validating user-pasted DSNs in `monitor login` and similar UX paths.
- Inside `monitor-node`, the framework bindings (Express / Fastify / Nest) are subdirectories of the same package, not separate packages. They share the singleton and a small request-scope abstraction.

## The `captureException` data flow

This is the path a single uncaught error walks from the moment an app calls `Neithly.captureException(err)` to the moment it lands in neithly-monitor's exception store.

### Step 1 — Scope snapshot

User code:

```ts
Neithly.setUser({ id: 'u_42', email: 'alice@example.com' });
Neithly.setTags({ feature: 'checkout' });
Neithly.addBreadcrumb({ category: 'ui.click', message: 'Pay button' });

try {
  doRiskyThing();
} catch (err) {
  Neithly.captureException(err);
}
```

The singleton holds a current `Scope` (from `@neithly-com/monitor-core`):

- `user` — the last `setUser` payload.
- `tags` / `extra` / `contexts` — last setter wins, with `withScope(fn)` pushing a child scope so callees can mutate without leaking back to the parent.
- `breadcrumbs` — a `BreadcrumbRing(100)` deque. Auto-instrumentation (`fetch`, `console`, `XHR`, navigation) pushes here continuously; user `addBreadcrumb` calls append directly.

On `captureException`, the singleton **clones** the current scope (so concurrent calls do not race) and freezes a `{ user, tags, extra, contexts, breadcrumbs }` snapshot.

### Step 2 — Exception shaping

`shapeException(err)` from `monitor-core` walks the `Error` (and `err.cause` chain, and any `AggregateError.errors`) and produces the OTel-semconv shape:

```ts
{
  'exception.type':       'TypeError',
  'exception.message':    'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading "id")',
  'exception.stacktrace': '<normalised stack with the SDK frames stripped>',
  'exception.cause': /* nested same shape, or undefined */,
}
```

The stack walker normalises file URIs, strips the SDK's own frames so they do not pollute symbolication, and caps the rendered stack at a sane size. Custom error classes survive — their `.name` becomes `exception.type`.

### Step 3 — `toOtlpLogRecord`

`toOtlpLogRecord({ scope, exception, level, timestamp })` from `monitor-core` produces a single OTLP `LogRecord` matching what the backend's `neithly-monitor` parser expects:

- `severity_number` / `severity_text` derived from `level` (default `error` for `captureException`, `info` for `captureMessage`).
- `body` set to the human-readable message.
- `attributes` carrying:
  - All `exception.*` fields from step 2.
  - `user.id`, `user.email`, etc. flattened from the scope.
  - `tags.*` and `extra.*` flattened with their respective prefixes.
  - `breadcrumbs` — JSON-serialised, capped at 16 KB, oldest dropped when over budget.
  - `service.name`, `service.version` (= release), `deployment.environment` from `init` config.

The function is shared between Node and browser. There is exactly one place that knows the wire shape, and the tests round-trip against the backend's parser fixture.

### Step 4 — Exporter

The runtime package wraps the OTel SDK's official `OTLPLogExporter` with two additions:

1. An `Authorization: Bearer <publicKey>` header, where `publicKey` is the 64-hex value parsed from the DSN by `parseDsn` (see [ADR-0001](./adr/0001-dsn-format.md)).
2. The endpoint resolved by `resolveEndpoints(dsnOrigin)` — `/v1/logs`, `/v1/metrics`, `/v1/traces` all derived from the single DSN origin.

On Node, the exporter feeds a `BatchLogRecordProcessor` so multiple `captureException` calls coalesce into one HTTP POST. On browser, the same shape is used, but `sendBeacon` takes over on `pagehide` to flush any in-flight envelope before the tab dies.

### Step 5 — Backend

The neithly-monitor backend's `/v1/logs` endpoint validates the bearer token against the `nmk_<env>_<64 hex>` token family, deserialises the OTLP LogRecord, and routes records carrying `exception.*` attributes into the exception store. Once landed, the SPA's Issues view picks them up via SSE; sourcemaps uploaded by `monitor-cli` symbolicate the stack trace on read.

### Failure modes

- `parseDsn` rejects malformed input with `DSN_MALFORMED` *synchronously inside `init`* — apps fail fast at boot rather than silently dropping events.
- The exporter retries with the OTel SDK's built-in backoff; on hard failure (4xx that isn't 429) it drops the batch and logs to `console.warn` once. We never block the host app.
- `flush(timeoutMs)` and `shutdown()` drain queued exporters; tests assert that all in-flight envelopes land before the promise resolves.

## Real-world wire contract (post-v0.1 QA findings)

The end-to-end QA pass on 2026-06-06 (see [`docs/qa/`](./qa/)) surfaced three
contract details that aren't obvious from the OTel spec or the backend
README. They are documented here so future SDK work doesn't re-discover them:

1. **`service.name` resource attribute MUST match the project's slug** — the
   backend's ingest worker silently drops records when this differs, returning
   `200 {}` to the SDK. Set `init({ serviceName: '<slug>' })` (or pin
   `service.name` directly on the resource attributes). See
   [Finding 01](./findings/01-service-name-mismatch.md).
2. **The DSN bearer is the FULL plaintext** including the `nmk_<env>_` prefix,
   not just the parsed `publicKey`. Internal SDK state holds the original
   `input` and uses that as `Authorization: Bearer <input>`. See
   [Finding 02](./findings/02-dsn-bearer-shape.md).
3. **DSNs with `allowedOrigins` reject node-side fetches** (Node never sends
   an `Origin` header). For server-side SDK use, mint the DSN with an empty
   `allowed_origins` list. The browser SDK never has this problem. See
   [Finding 03](./findings/03-allowed-origins-vs-node.md).

End-to-end propagation latency (POST → SPA row visible) measured at ~5 s on
the local stack, driven entirely by the SPA's SSE channel + TanStack Query
cache invalidation — no manual reload required.
